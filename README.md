This repository contains my college project on Ubuntu Server Hardening. The goal is to secure an Ubuntu server by implementing a series of configurations and best practices aimed at reducing vulnerabilities and fortifying system defenses. This project covers:

Configuring essential security settings
Enabling firewall rules with ufw
Setting up and managing auditd for event logging
Establishing secure user permissions and access controls
Automating alerts for security events
Enforcing system monitoring and intrusion detection
This project is a practical guide for anyone interested in securing Ubuntu servers, from beginners to intermediate users.
